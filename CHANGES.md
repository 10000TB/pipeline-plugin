## 0.1-beta-3
* Requires Jenkins core 1.577 or later.
* Support for running some builders and post-build actions from a flow using the same code as in freestyle projects. See [here](basic-steps/CORE-STEPS.md) for details.
* Added `catchError` step.

## 0.1-beta-2

* Simplified threading model for Groovy engine.
* Added `build` step.
* `StepExecution` now separated from `Step`.

* Requires Jenkins core 1.572 or later.
* Removed custom `mercurial` step; can now use a generic `scm` step (for example with the Mercurial plugin 1.51-beta-2 or later).
* Hyperlinking of prompts from the `input` step.
